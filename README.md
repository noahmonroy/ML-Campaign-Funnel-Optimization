# ML-Campaign-Funnel-Optimization
Marketing Analytics Project using Machine Learning

Background:
ABC Supermarket, a major UK retailer, operates numerous stores and a loyalty program with 250,000 participants. They've recently launched a line of organic products and aim for rapid market penetration. Their strategy involves an analytics-enabled marketing campaign targeting their loyalty base, with 10% already receiving free sample kits and their purchase decisions recorded. For the remaining 90%, they seek to target the most probable buyers based on demographic and loyalty program data.

Deliverables:
Our deliverable was an analytics-enabled marketing strategy to identify and target the most probable buyers for the new organic products campaign. Assumptions included imputing missing values and label encoding. We trained a machine learning model using logistic regression to predict buying probabilities, achieving 81% accuracy. Leveraging Google's free computational resources, our approach minimizes operational costs. Strategic options presented to the client include focusing on the top 40% of probable buyers, potentially yielding a gain of 196 million USD, and maximizing profit at 214 million USD while disregarding market penetration.
